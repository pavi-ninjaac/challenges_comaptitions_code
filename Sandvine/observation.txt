AFTER SEVERAL CHECK , i found there is no problem with the NUMBER OF PACKAGES , there is a problem with NUMBER OF WORKERS
# My first observation is the problem occures when the number of workers greater than 1 (when there is one worker the packages are correcctly delivered)
# 1) reason may be they are delivering the same package by 2 or more workers ---> need to fix it (count increament is happening even if the package alredy delivered is detected)

# 2) The logger didn't maintain the package delivered information correctly
# 3) Even after delivered the package, package delivered status didn't update.
# 4) Same package assigned to 2 or more workers (need to check already assigned or not while assigning packages) ((((CORRECT))))
# 5) Threading is used here, so there is a chance for "race condition".

SOLUTION:
after checking all the possibility
